- Change the primary and accent colours of the theme

- Change the not found page so that the url shows up in a different path. 

- Without editing the HTML, make the buttons in the counter component work. 

- Without deleting anything from the HTML, use a custom pipe to draw an asterisk () based on the value of counter. For every 5 in the value of the counter you should print one asterisk. So if the counter equaled 0 thru 4, there would be no stars. If counter was 10 thru 14 you would see one star. 

- Add a new component and service that get and display a random dad joke from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api#fetch-a-random-dad-joke

  - You will make the get request from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ with the headers set right. 
 
 - Add a routerLink and path to your new component in the sidebar and ensure that the joke will reload every time that link is clicked.
